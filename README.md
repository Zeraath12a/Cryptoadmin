As you know the private key bit range is 2^256 
so it is dificult to find out
SO i made a mnemonic phrase 
let me explain
â€¢ This whole system has a single dictionary of 2048 words(BIP39), it is from these words our software generates a key and enters the wallet to check the amount of $ on the balance.

â€¢ If there is money in the hacked wallet, you will not miss it, our software will send you a notification in Telegram with this exact key, so you can enter it and withdrawn money


*many people wonder "from which app are these wallets?". The answer is very simple -- from any. The key is the same for all wallets, you can create it in Trust Wallet and then transfer it to Exodus, no problem. Not the wallet creates the key, but the key creates the wallet :)

IS THIS LEGAL ? 
The answer is YES! Let me explain why:

â€¢ Wikipedia says:  Â«A private key is the main item that gives you the ability to own and control your wallet and funds. Whoever owns the private key is the wallet owner.Â»

â€¢ In addition, bitcoin is decentralized, which means that it has no technical support, all actions made in the blockchain - not cancelable. And if bitcoin disappears from your wallet, you won't even be able to prove it.
Moreover, there would be nobody to whom you can prove it ðŸ˜‰

â€¢ In 90% of cases, our software hacks old wallets that haven't had a transaction in years, and obviously access to them has been lost. So in fact, you're not stealing cryptocurrency from someone, you're taking back something lost.

*If you find a wallet with a balance that shows that someone is using it (the supposed owner), then the decision: to take it or not to take is up to you.
